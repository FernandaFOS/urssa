# `urssa` Unsupervised Routine Soil Spectral Analysis

<em><p align="right"> Bridging the gap between soil spectroscopy and traditional laboratory </p></em>

## About
The `urssa` code provides basic unsupervised functionalities for the use of spectra in laboratory routines. 
This repository provides a csv file conainting 350-2500 nm soil spectra and a code (divided in modelues) with a reproducible example.


## Core modules
- Internal quality control
- Samples selection for analysis and prediction
