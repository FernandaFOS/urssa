# `urssa` Unsupervised Routine Soil Spectral Analysis

<em><p align="right"> Bridging the gap between soil spectroscopy and traditional laboratory </p></em>

## About
The `urssa` code provides basic unsupervised functionalities for the use of spectra in laboratory routines. 
This repository provides a csv file conainting 350-2500 nm soil spectra and a code (divided in modelues) with a reproducible example.


## Core functionalities (routines)
- Correlation analysis between soil data and spectra
- Unsupervised spectral clustering of samples
- Internal quality control (outlier detection) for laboratories
- Samples selection for traditional analysis
- Samples selection for soil prediction (cost reduction)
